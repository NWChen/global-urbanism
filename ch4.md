# Intersections of Global (Urban Economic) Processes and Places

## From Keynesian Cities to Global Cities
- Keynesian cities were centers for routinized endeavours: administration, small-scale manufacturing, and commerce.
    - Major innovations originated from government, mass manufacturing, and mass construction of urban regions/infrastructure
- Global cities are strategic economic spaces because of:
    - __Intermediate services__ all (even the most material) economic sectors buying more insurance, accounting, legal, financial, consulting, software, etc. firm-oriented services
    - All economies feeding into the urban corporate services economy
    - Firms operating in more routinized/subnational markets increasingly buying service inputs from local/regional cities
- Global cities are able to handle the more complex needs of firms and exchanges operating globally

## Multiple Circuits of the Global Economy
- __Global circuits include__ specialized commodities circuits; financial/insurance servicing circuts; trading/manufacturing circuits
- Patterns emerge between global cities involved in economic circuits:
    - Combination of global dispersal and spatial concentration of global functions
    - Migration, cultural work, and civil society feed the formation and development of global circuits
- Global firms and markets need __more global cities__ as they expand their operations worldwide
    - As firms globalize and enter foreign national economies, the network of global cities grows

## Differences in Specialization Among Global Cities
- Capabilities needed to trade/finance/service/invest globally need to be produced
- __For a firm to go global, it has to operate in multiple cities__ which function as entry points into national economies.
- __Urban/rural specificity__ refers to the economic history and specialized economic strengths of a place; e.g. Chicago originated as a massive agro-industrial complex, while NYC always specialized in service exports, finance, and trade.

## Global Cities as Postindustrial Production Sites
- Mid-1980s saw sharp growth in:
    - Globalization of economic activity
    - Scale/complexity of international transactions, which feed the growth of multinational/advanced corporate services
- As they run increasingly dispersed operations, firms __always__ need to centralize their control/management/specialized servicing functions
- National and regional market firms can bypass the complexities of international borders/regulations
    - Their demand for specialized services encourages growth in second-order cities too

## New Urban Economic Cores
- High-level management and specialized service activities come to replace older, manufacturing-oriented office cores
- Opportunities to generate __superprofits__ in finance devalorize manufacturing, since __manufacturing cannot generate the superprofits__ possible in advanced financial activity.
- __Producer services__ are services for firms - financial, legal, general mangement, design, development, administration, personnel, maintenance, transport, communications, distribution, advertising, cleaning, security, storage.
    - Many producer-services have mixed business/consumer markets, e.g. insurance, banking/finance, real estate, legal, accounting.
    - Much of the producer-services sector is fed by financial/business transactions that have __nothing to do with manufacturing__, e.g. in global financial markets

## New Production Complexes
- __Agglomeration economies__ form when firms and people physically cluster (agglomerate) in cities.
    - Where agglomeration economies form, demand for specialized service firms sharply increases
- __Sharp urban primacy__ (dominance of a single city over other cities in a country) tends to entail disproportionate concentration of headquarters in the primate (dominant) city
    - Headquarters concentration is often linked to specific economic phases
        - e.g. internationalization of Japanese economy pushing firms to gain access to government regulators, thus moving their HQs to Tokyo
- __Territorial dispersal__ of transnational firms has contributed to the sharp rise of producer services
    - Firms running multiple plants/offices/service outlets must coordinate planning/administration/distribution/marketing
- __Global control capability__ refers to high levels of specialization, opportuniteis to externalize the production of some services, and growing demand by small/large firms and governments for those services
    - Small firms can buy components of global control capability thanks to high accessibility of those services; this contributes to the formation of marketplaces for such services in major cities
        - Large corporations are not the only users of global control capabilities, but are the prime beneficiaries

## Emerging (Foreign Professional) Global Labor Market
- Demand for a global labor market has vastly expanded due to
    - the changing character of economic globalization
    - the growing segmentation of specialized labor markets
    - demographic changes in global cities
- Securing home-country professionals to run a firm's overseas operations is insufficient. __Foreign professional workers play a new role in global firms__.
    - Importance of hiring foreign professional workers is expected to grow due to firms' need for engagement with national/regional/local political economies
    - Global firms will have to bring foreign professionals into the highest level of home headquarters to help firms understand local cultures/talents
    - Local (foreign) professionals will be hired to _run_ foreign offices, not just _staff_ those offices
- __Incomplete knowledge__ problem - the more digitized/globalized a firm's operations, the more acute its incomplete knowledge problem due to the acceleration of operations/decisions in highly digitized sectors
    - Foreign professionals help address the incomplete knowledge problem by providing insight into established country-specific economic culture, informal trust
- __Urban knowledge capital__ refers to the diversity networks/information loops/professionals which produce a particular type of knowledge capital
    - Globalization _needs_ the specialized differences of cities; each global city has a unique urban knowledge capital
