# New Inequalities Within Cities

## Transformations in the Organization of Labor Processes
- Work that was once standardized/mass produced is today increasingly characterized by customization/flexible specialization/subcontractor networks/informalization
    - Changes in job supply/reorganization of work become very clear in major cities
- In post-WW2 era, __inequality was systematically reduced__ and a middle class developed due to mass production/consumption driven by:
    - fixed-capital intensity
    - standardized production
    - suburbanization-led growth
- Recently, __destabilization of employment__ driven by
    - increasing casualization/informalization of jobs
    - increasing polarization of employment opportunities between social divisions (women, minorities, immigrants)
- Immigration/variation in migrant concentration in central cities contributes to changes in spatial patterns in labor supply

## The Informal Economy
- Downgraded manufacturing sector is largely composed of informal economic activities
- In terms of circulation of goods/services, the  __informal economy consists of__ two spheres:
    - Small immigrant-owned shops in immigrant economies, meeting the demands of this sphere's members
    - Firms using informalization to maximize profits, e.g. via subcontracting/direct acquisition of goods/services, meeting the demands of _formal_ economics ectors
- Informalization tends to downgrade manufacturing work and mass-consumer services
    - Also lowers costs of high-priced goods/services for non-mass-consumer markets

## Earnings Distribution in a Service-Dominated Economy
- Earnings inequality is growing
    - Some inequality is mitigated by collective bargaining/wage-setting centralization in regulated countries
- Recent general decline in relative economic well-being of the least-skilled
    - Wage collapse largely occurring in low-education worker populations

## The Birth of Global Slums
- __Megaslums__ are formed on the periphery of global cities due to global economic restructuring
    - Living in the countryside is untenable for many people
- Rural livelihoods increasingly destroyed by policies that open international markits/produce profit-making opportunities for the rich:
    - Privatization of public utilities
    - Elimination of agricultural subsidies
    - Reduction of tariffs on foreign imports
    - Cuts in public spending

## The Restructuring of Urban Consumption
- In the US, expansion of high-income workforce and emerging new cultural forms has led to high-income gentrification resting on the availability of a vast supply of low-wage workers
    - High-income gentrification is labor-intensive more than capital-intensive (capital intensity replaced with workers)
- High-income workers to be distinguished from the core wealthy residents of major cities
    - Their disposable income is not enough to make them major investors
    - Instead, this income creates large demand to ensure economic viability for producers/providers of highly-priced goods/services
- __Expansion in low-income populations contributes to the proliferation of small operations__ and movemnet away from large-scale factories/chain-stores
    - Consumption needs of low-income populations are met by small/family labor manufacturing/retail establishments
- In large slums, an informal economy has expanded to meet the needs of rapidly growing populations
