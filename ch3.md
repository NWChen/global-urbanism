# National and Transnational Urban Systems

## Global Patterns of Urbanization
- __Urban primacy__ phenomenon where a single city becomes the dominant (primate) city in a coutnry. Measures the distribution of a country's urban population.
- __Immigrant distribution__ immigrants in global cities comprise an integral part of cities' workforce and social sphere.
- __Diasporic networks__ global cities' transnationality enables them to bypass national states, enabling the connection of diasporas' geographically scattered groups.
    - Corresponds to a transnational urban system where issues like immigration, asylum, international women's agendas, antiglobalization, etc. are more dominant.
    - Results in an intensification of transactions among diasporic and nondiasporic groups within a city.

## Global Circuits
- Worldwide grid of global cities encourages transmigration of capital, people (rich/professional and poor/migrant), and cultures
- __Microenvironments with global span__ are small, local communities technologically connected with similar entities (in the same city/country or abroad), enabling local politcial/nonpolitical actors to enter cross-border politics.
    - Drives global civil societies incorporating individuals' political passions
    - Drives the creation of transnational identities
    - Increases the risk of nationalism and fundamentalism

## Multiple Meanings of Urban Growth
- General increase in internationalization of production
- Development of migrant accommodation in global cities strongly swings nations' levels of urban primacy
- Transnationalization of economic activity is raising the intensity/volume of transactions among cities
- Transnational urban system marked by:
    - Growth of global markets for finance/specialized services
    - Need for transational service networks due to increases in international investment
    - Reduced government regulation of international economic activity
- Powerless groups in global cities increasingly active in transnational networks, producing new intercity networks
    - Large growth in megaslums in the peripheries of major cities
