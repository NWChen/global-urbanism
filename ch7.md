# Global Survival Circuits
- Thanks to globalization, the dire financial straits of less-developed governments/economies, especially in the global South, launch a new phase of global migration and people trafficking.
- Both strategies function as survival mechanisms and profit-making activities.
- The same infrastructure facilitating cross-border flows of capital/information/trade also unintentionally structurally facilitate exchange of women/migrant labor for countries' survival

## The Feminization of Survival
- Immigrant women enter the migration process in different ways, including via:
    - __Profit/revenue-making circuits__ using/involving the disadvantaged; e.g. illegal sex/labor trafficking
    - __Cross-border migrations__ generating remittances for home countries
    - __Caretaker demand__ in global cities
- Globalizing and __developing__ economies are marked by growing unemployment; closures of small/medium-size enterprises in national (as opposed to export) markets; large, increasing government debt.
    - Women taken on additional household responsibilities in these economies.
    - Men have lost earnings opportunities; governments cut back on social services supporting women and their family responsibilities.
- In many developing economies, opportunities for male employment shrink since:
    - These economies increasingly accept foreign firms in a widening range of economic sectors
    - These economies are pressured to develop export industries
    - Government revenue falls due to the above conditions + debt servicing
- Many countries with large exports of female workers to service industries in highly-developed nations hold large amounts of external debt
- __Feminization of survival__ characterized by dependence of households, communities, and governments on women for their survival

## How Immigrant Women Enter the Migration Process
- __Prostitution and labor migration__ are growing in importance as ways to make a living
- __Illegal trafficking__ in women/children for the sex/labor industry is growing in importance as a way to generate profit
- __Remittances__ sent by emigrants and organized exports of workers are important sources of revenue for developing governments

## Alternative Survival Circuits
- Less-developed countries are marked by high unemployment; poverty; bankruptcies of many firms; shrinking resources in the state to meet social needs.
- __Trafficking__ involves the forced recruitment/transportation of people within/across states for _coerced_ work/service.
    - Dominated by the sex market; labor market; illegal migration.
- Sex trade is sometimes a development strategy in areas with high unemployment/poverty, with governments desperate for revenue/foreign exchange reserves
    - Organized crime, cross-border ethnic networks, and growing transnationalization suggest likely further development of a global sex industry
- __When local manufacturing and agriculture can no longer function as sources of employment/profits/government revenue__, what was once a marginal source of earnings, profits, and revenues becomes far more important.
