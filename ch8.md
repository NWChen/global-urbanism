# The Urbanizing of Global Governance Challenges

## Global Governance Challenges
- In global cities, these challenges include: 
    - Environmental challenges
    - Human insecurity (spread of violence, racism)
    - Urbanizing of war (due to asymmetric war)
    - Sharp rise in economic forms of violence
- Cities are a frontier space for:
    - New sustainable energy sources; construction processes; infrastructure
    - Intercity networks involving NGOs; formal urban governments; informal activists; global firms; immigrants

## Cities as Frontier Spaces for Global Governance
- __New military asymmetries__
    - National security is a source of urban insecurity
        - What may be good for the protection of the nation-state may come at a high price to major cities and their people
- __Global warming, energy, water insecurity__
    - Everyday city life relies on massive infrastructure and institutional-level support for life-support.
    - Emergent and highly threatening problems; need to be addressed urgently
- __Urban violence__
    - Good governance imposes macro-level normative propositions, but urban violence escapes these rules
    - Militarized responses may be inadequate or escalate conflict

## Bridging the Ecologies of Cities and the Biosphere
- __Urban hinterland__ the outskirts of a city; the interface between urban and rural
    - Modern urban hinterlands are now global hinterlands
- __Anthropocene epoch__ shift in geological dominance over planet to human dominance - urbanization and industrialization make humankind the biggest consumer and destroyer of all significant ecosystems
- Rural societies adopt environmentally harmful production processes
    - Extreme capitalism drives rural poverty, and, resultingly, environmentally destructive practices
- Modern major cities differ in environmental sustainability; differences originate from:
    - Diverse government/industrial policies
    - Diverse economic bases/cultures/community norms/lifestyles
- __Delegating back to nature__ refers to using the capacities of the biosphere to augment human innovations.

## Multiscalar Bridging Between Cities and the Biosphere
- There are two popular extremes about how to bridge cities and the biosphere:
    - Cities can only contribute to sustainability via mitigation/adaptation
    - Cities must start from scratch
- __Made and unmade__ refers to the potential for cities to both generate and technologically/societally mitigate pollution and waste. 

## When Finance Hits Urban Space
- Finance needs to __make capital__, resulting in the construction of speculative instruments and the financializing of nonfinancial sectors
- Negative effects of financialization of material assets in cities are rarely considered

## Financial Crisis as Systemic Logic
- Financial profit can either be promptly materialized into a nonfinancial asset, or used as a paltform for additional financial construction
- Financial assets have grown far more rapidly than the overall economy of developed coutnries (as measured by GDP)
- Recurrent crises are an expectation of the financial system

## National Security Makes Urban Insecurity
- __Asymmetric war__ is warfare between a conventional army and armed insurgents, which thus largely takes place in cities regardless of whether they harbor allies or enemies
- The new urban map of war expands beyond the nations involved
    - __Multisited war__ consists of distributed, variable actions that gain larger m eaning from a particular conflict with global projection (e.g. terrorist bombings in global cities)
    - Asymmetric wars are partial, intermittent, and lack clear endings; they are enormously diverse in terms of territory, authority, and rights
    - Asymmetric wars often reactivate older conflicts between two unconventional forces in historically/culturally unstable areas
- Contemporary (symmetric or asymmetric) wars often involve __forced urbanization__, especially in less developed areas
    - Warring bodies avoid direct confrontation, instead controlling territory by purging specific groups of people, driving others to flee
- Cities become a technology for containing conventional military powers (which can't navigate them as effectively as insurgents), and a technology of resistance for armed insurgencies
