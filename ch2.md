# The Urban Impact of Economic Globalization

## Sources of New Forms of Economic Globalization
- Export-processing zones, offshore banking centers, high-tech districts, global cities
- __Intermediated relationship between cities and other sources of economic globalization__
    - The more manufacturing is offshored, the more the manufacturer's umbrella corporation requires highly specialized legal/financial/accounting services
    - The more a high-tech district's global market/innovation expands/increases, the more the corporation requires highly specialized legal/financial/accounting services

## Geographic Axes of Economic Globalization
- When international flows consist of raw materials/agricultural products/mining goods, the geography of transactions is in part determined by the location of natural resources
    - e.g. Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean used to be key sites in this geography
- When finance and specialized services became the dominant component of international transactions (early 1980s), the role of the physical goods geography decreased and the role of the global financial/service centers geography increased
- Two geographic axes constitute modern economic globalization:
    - __North-South axis__ - major capital imports/exports between the US/UK/France/Germany/China, and developing countries (Africa/South America).
    - __East-West axis__ - sharp growth of investment and trade within US/Western Europe/Japan triad, loss of overall international investment share among developing countries

## The Role of Foreign Direct Investment in Economic Globalization
- __FDI refers to investors acquiring a firm, wholly or in part, or building/setting up new firms in a foreign country__.
- FDI is indicative of a new geography of international transactions.
- Growth in FDI during the 1980s/90s took place through internationalization of production of goods/services/portfolio investment (buying firms)
- Growth in FDI during the 2000s takes place through services/globalization of finance/increasing financialization of economic sectors
- FDI is growing in both scale and scope: land is a rapidly growing component of FDI by rich governments/firms
    - Africa/Russia/Ukraine/Latin America are major destinations for these investments
    - Governments and global (mining/food growing/financial) firms are buyers

## The Global City Production Function
- __Refers to the domination of global economic activity by global cities via highly specialized/non-routinized markets and firms__.
- Cities in the global economy are heavily influenced by the composition of international transactions
- Crucial sites for financial and services transactions lie in financial markets, advanced corporate service firms, banks, and transnational corporations headquarters.

## Dispersal and Global Integration
- Modern growth observed in the number of cities integrated in the global financial network
- Modern growth observed in the concentration of value managed at the top of the hierarchy of corporations/organizations
- Geographic dispersal of manufacturing/offices/service outlets and growing number of stock markets aroundn the world was __not__ accompanied by decentralization in control/central functions of corporations.
- Mixture of globally dispersed firm operations and concentration of management functions in firm headquarters increasingly enables capture of worldwide low-end wealth and small firms' capital
