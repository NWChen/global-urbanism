These notes are brief summaries for each chapter of _Cities In A World Economy_ by Saskia Sassen. They provide a vocabulary of key terms/concepts that are often used in _Global Urbanism_, with the hope of implicitly driving Saskia-isms into your writing.

As a result these notes lack concrete examples; for that content, turn to your notes.
