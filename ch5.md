# Issues and Case Studies in the New Urban Economy

## Financial Centers in the Global Digital Era
- 1980s-era global integration of markets and deregulations led to elimination of redundant systems, complicating collaboration among financial institutions
- Financial systems are now more globally distributed; each of ~20 global leading centers has distinct specializations
- The global financial system grows by incorporating more and more _national_ economies
    - Specialized collaborative efforts are increasing across borders to accommodate the globally integrated financial system

## Concentration and Dispersal in the Global Digital Era
- ~20 global centers have disproportionate financial power
- Consolidation of 1-2 leading financial centers in a country is a function of rapid growth in finance, _not_ of decay in losing cities
- __Modern, digitized global finance is characterized by two trends__:
    - Consolidation in fewer major centers across/within countries
    - Sharp growth in # of centers becoming part of the global network as countries deregulate their economies
- Both globalization and electronic trading are about __expansion and dispersal__ beyond national economies, driving demand for agglomeration

## Agglomeration in the Global Digital Era
- Growing digitization suggests global financial centers are less important
    - High cost of operating in major financial centers supports benefits of geographic dispersal
- Geographic decentralization of financial activities is occurring, but is merely decentralization of a firm's operations
    - Firms' central HQs still retain control and appropriation of profits
- Reasons for consolidation of financial firms into (highly primate) centers, rather than massive dispersal:
    - __Social connectivity__. Financial centers provide the social connectivity that allow firms/markets to maximize technological connectivity and handle the added pressures brought onto financial firms by the speed of financial activity.
        - Central coordination and control functions for financial firms/markets is needd to operate a widely dispersed network of firm branches/affiliates
        - Access to talent and specialized corporate services is most concentrated in centers
    - __Need for resources__. The need for enormous (talent, corporate, market) resources to handle global operations + the growth of complex central functions increase demand for financial centers, both wrt professional labor concentration and number of centers worldwide.
        - Financial centers collaborate and divide labor, both across borders and between markets. 
    - __Denationalization of the corporate elite__. Deregulization and privatization have weakened the need for _national_ financial centers
        - Global financial products are accessible in national markets
            - National investors can operate in global markets
        - National identities are weakening for global financial players and their customers.

## Space Economy of Centrality
- Three patterns among major cities/developed countries:
    - Since 1980s, an increase in the # of firms in the centers of major cities explainable by growth in leading sectors and ancillary industries
    - Along with central city growth, dense nodes of commercial/business activity/development form in a broader urban region
        - __Edge cities__ - significant concentrations of offices/business activities alongside residential areas in peripheral areas
    - Growing intensity in __localness__ (marginality) of areas/sectors operating outside dominant global markets, resulting in increased poverty/disadvantage
- Megaregional scale of global cities connects _winners_ and _laggards_
    - Megaregions include both globalizing and provincial cities, high- and low-development areas.
    - __Dispersal locations__ strengthen the dynamic economies of megaregions, since they make the most of negative externalities. Such locations are _laggards_ supporting _winners_.
